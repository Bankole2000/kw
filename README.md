## What it is
A Demo of a Peer to Peer Donation Platform... Created strictly for Bragging rights (although I might sell it someday, if I ever get ethically/morally compromised, who knows, lol). Built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JS - ES5 & ES6
* A little JQuery
* PHP
* MySQL
* [Materialize CSS](http://www.materializecss.com/) - Material Design CSS FrameWork
* [Google Material Icons](https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/) - Icon Font
* [Guts](https://www.wikihow.com/Love-Programming) - Strictly for the love of coding _Mehn!_

## What it does

* Google Signin
* Chat Functionality
* Normal GH/PH stuff
* Admin Control Panel
* Strike system
* Very appealing Design

## Learning Points

* All of PHPs bullshit
* MySQL in all its glory
* DOM Manipulation & Traversal
* Event Handing & Delegation
* Creating & Appending Elements
* Local Storage Object Methods
* Materialize Alerts & Toasts

## Some cool stuff
Lots of Cool stuff to discuss, but I'm too lasy right now: 
```php
// I'll put some code here but I'm lazy right now
``` 
Also [Materialize CSS Toasts](https://materializecss.com/toasts.html) Are Awesome!!!. And their Call backs mixed with Modal uses just makes for a very sophisticated ui. I'll put the code but lazy rn.
```javascript
M.init(); // Initializes Materialize JS
M.toast({html:'',displayLength:1200});
// will insert toast Call back code here later. tired af rn
```
## Features in Development
  Still working on these (its just laziness that's made me not get around to em yet though, but you can tell from the UI they're supposed to be there)
* Records Pages
* Admin Panel Security
* Some other pages n stuff
